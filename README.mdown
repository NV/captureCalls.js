# captureCalls.js

[Demo](http://nv.github.io/captureCalls.js/)


## Usage

There are two ways to use captureCalls.js: a Chrome extension or a standalone script.

### [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/capturecalls/jbifbiilihmmfjcbfbbdhknaehdgbabd)

Once installed, it runs on all web sites and defines `captureCalls` function globally,
so it can be used not only in DevTools console but in all JavaScripts as well.

### Standalone script

Download [captureCalls.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NV/captureCalls.js/gh-pages/chrome/captureCalls.js)
and include it into your web page `<script src="captureCalls.js"></script>`.

Itâ€™s generally a good idea to include captureCalls.js only for a developer environment
 and keep it out of production.


## Options

**captureCalls.stacktrace**  
`true`: include stack traces in the output

**captureCalls.logFileNames**  
`true`: show URLs with line numbers, e.g. `http://nv.github.io/captureCalls.js/demo/demo.js:7`

**captureCalls.logDetails**  
`false`: show an object with details, e.g. `{this: window, function: function() {[native]}}`


## TODO

 - Write on how captureCalls is superior to Chrome DevTools `monitor` function.
